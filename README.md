# Motivational-Video-Player-Public

## This is project is conisdered done but it still has way to go to become a fullfledged app

# Goal of the project
The project was intended to be my first app uploaded to the app store but I didn't upload it in the end, because I thought it lacked a key feature that would make the app not as valuable as I intended it to be in my opinion.

# What can you do?
You can do quite a few things you start by selecting a category of motivation that you like then you will via Youtube API get motivational videos that are about that selected category. 
It is a full-fledge video player you can play/pause can you seek forward and backward in time of a video and you also skip the usual functionality I would say. 
A key feature of the app is that you can bookmark videos that you like and the metadata of the videos is saved using core data so you can view the video later if you want.

## technologies/Frameworks used 
SwiftUI, CoreData, Google Admob, KingFischer (Swift package)
